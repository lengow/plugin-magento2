A Lengow account is created during the extension installation and you will have free access to our platform for 15 days. To benefit from all the functionalities of Lengow, this requires you to pay for an account on the Lengow platform.

## Plugin installation

Follow the instruction below if you want to install Lengow for Magento 2 using Git.

1.) Clone the git repository in the Magento 2 `app/code` folder using:

    git clone git@github.com:lengow/plugin-magento2.git Lengow/Connector

In case you wish to contribute to the plugin, fork the `dev` branch rather than cloning it, and create a pull request via Github. For further information please read the section "Become a contributor" of this document.

2.) Set the correct directory permissions:

    chmod -R 755 app/code/Lengow/Connector

Depending on your server configuration, it might be necessary to set whole write permissions (777) to the files and folders above.
You can also start testing with lower permissions due to security reasons (644 for example) as long as your php process can write to those files.

3.) Connect via SSH and run the following commands (make sure to run them as the user who owns the Magento files!)

    php bin/magento module:enable Lengow_Connector
    php bin/magento maintenance:enable
    php bin/magento setup:upgrade
    php bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy
    php bin/magento maintenance:disable

4.) Go to "System" > "Cache Management" and click both the "Flush Magento Cache" as well as the "Flush Cache Storage" button. This is required to activate the extension.

5.) Log in with your Lengow credentials and configure the plugin

### Translation

Translations in the plugin are managed via a key system and associated yaml files.

Please note that in Magento 2, English content is used as the translation key.
You have to be careful that the English translation is identical in the code and in the yml files.
